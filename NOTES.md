# SupplySight - Project Notes

## Key Decisions & Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- **State Management**: Apollo Client for GraphQL state management and caching
- **UI Components**: Custom component library with Tailwind CSS for styling
- **Error Handling**: Granular error handling at the component level for better user experience

### Backend Architecture
- **GraphQL API**: Single endpoint for flexible data fetching
- **Modular Structure**: Organized by features/modules for better maintainability
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript throughout the codebase

## Trade-offs Made

1. **Error Handling**
   - Chose granular error handling over global error boundaries to maintain partial UI functionality
   - Trade-off: Slightly more code but better user experience

2. **Data Fetching**
   - Using Apollo Client's built-in caching instead of additional state management
   - Trade-off: Simpler code but potentially larger bundle size

3. **UI/UX**
   - Custom components over UI library for better control
   - Trade-off: More development time but better performance and customization

## Testing Strategy

### Current Coverage
- Basic component rendering tests
- Simple interaction tests

### Testing Improvements Needed

1. **Unit Testing**
   - Add Jest/React Testing Library for component testing
   - Test complex business logic in isolation
   - Test custom hooks and utility functions

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test component interactions
   - Test data fetching and state updates
   - Test error states and edge cases

3. **E2E Testing**
   - Add Cypress for full user journey testing
   - Test critical paths (login, data loading, filtering)
   - Visual regression testing

## Performance Optimizations

### Implemented
- Code splitting with React.lazy and Suspense
- Memoization of expensive calculations
- Efficient re-renders with React.memo

### Potential Improvements
1. **Bundle Size**
   - Analyze bundle with source-map-explorer
   - Implement dynamic imports for non-critical components
   - Consider code-splitting at route level

2. **Data Fetching**
   - Implement pagination for large datasets
   - Add data prefetching for better perceived performance
   - Optimize GraphQL queries to request only needed fields

## Future Enhancements

### Short-term
- [ ] Add loading skeletons for better perceived performance
- [ ] Implement proper form validation
- [ ] Add comprehensive error boundaries
- [ ] Improve accessibility (a11y) compliance

### Long-term
- [ ] Implement offline support with service workers
- [ ] Add real-time updates with GraphQL subscriptions
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Add performance monitoring (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket)

## Development Experience

### Current Setup
- TypeScript for type safety
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- Vite for fast development server

### Improvements
- Add husky for git hooks
- Set up commit linting
- Add Storybook for component documentation
- Implement testing in CI pipeline

## Security Considerations
- Input validation on both client and server
- Proper error handling to avoid leaking sensitive information
- Secure API endpoints with proper authentication/authorization
- Regular dependency updates to patch vulnerabilities
